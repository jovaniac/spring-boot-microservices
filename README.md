Rebuild REST APIs using Microservice Archtecture. 

## Architectures Desgin and Technologies
<pre>
1, <b>Registry Server (Eureka Server)</b>: Eureka Naming Server will register all services.

2, <b>Gatewayâ€Š (Zuul)</b>: Gateway will validate JWT token and forward all valid incoming requests based on urls. If 
   not token, will deny request. If calling for authenticate, request will forward to Authentication Server.
   
3, <b>Authentication Server (Eureka client)</b>: Validate User by check username and password in Database or using 
   Oauth2 (Social Login).
   Using Java Keystores to store Private and Public key pair. JWT is created and signed with Private key. Expose 
   an endpoint to get Public key.
    
3, <b>Config Server Eureka clients</b>: Centralized place for properties. Geting property files from Github repository.

4, <b>Project Service (Eureka clients)</b>: REST API endpoints to perform Project related operations (JPA) 

5, <b>Contact Service (Eureka clients)</b>: REST API endpoints to perform Contact related operations (JPA)

6, <b>Test Service (Eureka clients)</b>: This is for test purpose. REST API endpoints for test purpose. 
   To test <b>Retry</b>, <b>Circuit Breaker</b>
   
7, <b>Sleuth and Zipkin Server</b>: Call trace is sending to Zipking Server, it's help us to trace calls and debug.

8, <b>service-libs</b> package: Lib for share code used by other services. 
   If code changed, need run: mvn clean install
</pre>

## Security Design and workflow
<pre>
Using JWT token (included Expiration time and User role) to validate User access. First time when user trying to login, redirect to Authentication Server.

<b>"Authentication Server Desgin"</b>
1) If user choose to login using username and password, then validate again User information stored in Database along with User role. 
2) If user choose to login using social login, redirect to Social Login page, if user grant access (email and profile). System will automatically create a new account using Email.

On success login, JWT token will generated containing User roles, and sign with Private Key from Key Store, and return as login response. 
Also and there is a REST endpoint to access Public Key.

<b>Public and Private Key"</b>
Public and Private key are stored in Key Store to prevent outside getting private key.

<b>"Each Individual Services"</b>
Call to Each individule Service also need be validated using JWT token to improve security on individual service level. Each Service will fetch Public key from Auth Server and then validate incoming JWT token. If validation fail, request get rejected. If success, resoure will be returned.

</pre>

## Deployment
Each service contains a Dockerfile, and a docker image are on docker hub:
https://cloud.docker.com/repository/list

We can be deployed to Cloud provide using Kubernetes or Cloud Provider have it's own tool for easy deployment. 
For instance:
AWS we can use ECS to deploy docker into EC2 instances and do auto-scaling. 

## TODO List
<pre>
1, <b>Add Centralized logging (ELK Stack) </b>: Need check out options and add centralized logging mechanism.
